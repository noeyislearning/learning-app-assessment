    <p>We&apos;ve gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags, that first document, to having 100 more elements now, and yet it&apos;s still the same language. I find that amazing. It&apos;s still the same language that was created 25 years ago. It&apos;s grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it&apos;s still the same language.</p>

  <p>HTML has evolved over time.</p>

    <p>If you&apos;re familiar at all with computer formats, this is very surprising. If you tried to open a Word processing document from the same time as when Tim Berners-Lee was creating the World Wide Web project, good luck. You&apos;d probably have to run some emulation just to get the thing open. And yet you could open an HTML document from back then in a browser today.</p>

  <p>The original HTML will work just fine in today's browsers. And today's HTML will be accepted by early browsers. A few things might reznder differently, but the page will still render.</p>
