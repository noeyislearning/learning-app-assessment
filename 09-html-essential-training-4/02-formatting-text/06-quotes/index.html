    <p>We&apos;ve gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags, that first document, to having 100 more elements now, and yet it&apos;s still the same language. I find that amazing. It&apos;s still the same language that was created 25 years ago. It&apos;s grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it&apos;s still the same language.</p> <!-- Add a paragraph of text to the blockquote element -->

    <p>If you&apos;re familiar at all with computer formats, this is very surprising. If you tried to open a Word processing document from the same time as when Tim Berners-Lee was creating the World Wide Web project, good luck. You&apos;d probably have to run some emulation just to get the thing open. And yet you could open an HTML document from back then in a browser today.</p> <!-- Add another paragraph of text to the blockquote element -->

  <p>The original HTML will work just fine in today's browsers. And today's HTML will be accepted by early browsers. A few things might reznder differently, but the page will still render.</p> <!-- Add a paragraph of text to the body of the document -->

  <p>Jeremy Keith said, <q>You could open an HTML document from back then in a browser today.</q></p> <!-- Add a paragraph of text to the body of the document, with a quote element -->

  <p lang="fr">Jeremy Keith a déclaré: <q>Vous pouvez aujourd&apos;hui ouvrir un document HTML dans un navigateur.</q></p> <!-- Add a paragraph of text to the body of the document, with a quote element and a French language attribute -->

  <p lang="bg">Джереми Кийт каза:  <q>Можете да отворите HTML документ от тогава още в браузър днес.</q></p> <!-- Add a paragraph of text to the body of the document, with a quote element and a Bulgarian language attribute -->

    NOTES:
    - The <blockquote> element in HTML is used to define a section of quoted text. It is a block-level element, which means that it takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line after it.
    - The <cite> element in HTML is used to define the title of a work, such as the title of a book, a song, a movie, a TV show, a painting, a sculpture, etc. It is an inline-level element, which means that it only takes up as much width as necessary and does not create a new line after it.
    - The <q> element in HTML is used to define a short quotation. It is an inline-level element, which means that it only takes up as much width as necessary and does not create a new line after it.
    - The <q> element can be used inside a <p> element to define a short quotation inside a paragraph of text. For example:
      <p>Jeremy Keith said, <q>You could open an HTML document from back then in a browser today.</q></p>
    - The <q> element can also be used inside a <p> element with a lang attribute to define a short quotation in a different language. For example:
      <p lang="fr">Jeremy Keith a déclaré: <q>Vous pouvez aujourd'hui ouvrir un document HTML dans un navigateur.</q></p>
      <p lang="bg">Джереми Кийт каза:  <q>Можете да отворите HTML документ от тогава още в браузър днес.</q></p>
    
    OTHER EXPLANATION:
    - The <body> element contains the visible content of the document. The <blockquote> element is used to create a blockquote, and the <p> element is used to create a paragraph of text. The <cite> element is used to create a citation for the blockquote.
    - The <q> element is used to create a short inline quotation. The lang attribute is used to specify the language of the quotation.
