    NOTES:
    - Headlines are used to create a hierarchy of content on a page. The <h1> element is the most important headline on the page, and the <h6> element is the least important. 
    - Headlines are block-level elements, which means that they take up the full width of their parent container and create a new line after them.
    - Headlines are also used by search engines to determine the importance of content on a page. The <h1> element is the most important headline on the page, and the <h6> element is the least important.

    In this example, the <body> element contains the visible content of the document. The <h1> through <h6> elements are used to create headlines of different levels, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> being the least important.

    OTHER EXPLNAATIONS:
    In the provided code excerpt, the <body> element contains the visible content of the document. The <h1> through <h6> elements are used to create headlines of different levels, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> being the least important.
