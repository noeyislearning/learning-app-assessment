  <!-- Create a paragraph element and add some text to it -->
  <p>If you just put all the content in an HTML file with no markup, it just ends up as one big blob on the website. The browser assumes it's all one long string of text.</p> 
  <!-- Create another paragraph element and add some text to it -->
  <p>We can try to create separate paragraphs by leaving a bunch of space in our HTML file, but that space doesn't count. The browser ignores it. All these words simply add up to a bunch of words in a row.</p> 
  <!-- Create another paragraph element and add some text to it -->
  <p>The browser doesn't know what this is, because we haven't used any HTML yet to tell it what this is.</p> 

  <!-- 
    NOTES:
    The <p> element in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It is a block-level element, which means that it takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line after it.

    You can also add other HTML elements inside a <p> element to create more complex content. For example:

    <p>This is a paragraph of text with a <a href="#">link</a> in it.</p>

    In this example, we create a <p> element with some text and a link inside it. The link is created using the <a> element and the href attribute.
