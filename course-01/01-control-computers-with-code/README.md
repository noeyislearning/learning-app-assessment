# History of Programming

Early 1840's, Charles Babbage, a British mathematician, designed a machine called the Analytical Engine. It was designed to perform mathematical calculations. It was never built, but it was the first design for a programmable computer. Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is considered to be the first computer programmer. She wrote a program for the Analytical Engine that would calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers. She also wrote a program that would calculate the sequence of numbers that are generated by Babbage's machine. She is considered to be the first computer programmer because she was the first person to write a program for a machine that was never built.

## Theoretical to Physical, Manual to Automatic, Analog to Digital

With the birth of mainframe computers, data processing requires instructions to be sent int the machine and interpret the instructions from the programmer. These will applied by data to organized and analyzed it.
